    "1.A relative path refers to a location that is relative to a current directory. Relative paths make use of two special symbols, a dot (.) and a double-dot (..), which translate into the current directory and the parent directory. Double dots are used for moving up in the hierarchy.\n",

    "2.An absolute path refers to the complete details needed to locate a file or folder, starting from the root element and ending with the other subdirectories. Absolute paths are used in websites and operating systems for locating files and folders. An absolute path is also known as an absolute pathname or full path.\n",

    "6.The access modes available for the open() function are as follows: r : Opens the file in read-only mode. Starts reading from the beginning of the file and is the default mode for the open() function. rb : Opens the file as read-only in binary format and starts reading from the beginning of the file\n",

    "7.To open a file in write mode, “w” is specified. When mode “w” is specified, it creates an empty file for output operations. What if the file already exists? If a file with the same name already exists, its contents are discarded and the file is treated as a new empty file.\n",

    "8.The main difference is that read() will read the whole file at once and then print out the first characters that take up as many bytes as you specify in the parenthesis versus the readline() that will read and print out only the first characters that take up as many bytes as you specify in the parenthesis\n",

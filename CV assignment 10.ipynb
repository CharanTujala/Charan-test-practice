    "1.ans-Zero initialization:\n",
    "If all the weights are initialized to zeros, the derivatives will remain same for every w in W[l]. As a result, neurons will learn same features in each iterations. This problem is known as network failing to break symmetry. And not only zero, any constant initialization will produce a poor result\n",

    "3.Ans-Dilated Convolution: It is a technique that expands the kernel (input) by inserting holes between its consecutive elements. In simpler terms, it is the same as convolution but it involves pixel skipping, so as to cover a larger area of the input.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4.Ans--Transposed convolutions are standard convolutions but with a modified input feature map. The stride and padding do not correspond to the number of zeros added around the image and the amount of shift in the kernel when sliding it across the input, as they would in a standard convolution operation\n",

    "\n",
    "5.Ans--Spatially Separable Convolutions\n",
    "The kernel that can be separated across spatial axes is called the spatially separable kernel. The kernel is broken into two smaller kernels and those kernels are multiplied sequentially with the input image to get the same effect of the full kerne\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Ans-Depthwise Convolution is a type of convolution where we apply a single convolutional filter for each input channel. In the regular 2D convolution performed over multiple input channels, the filter is as deep as the input and lets us freely mix channels to generate each element in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Ans-Depthwise Separable Convolutions. Unlike spatial separable convolutions, depthwise separable convolutions work with kernels that cannot be “factored” into two smaller kernels. Hence, it is more commonly used. This is the type of separable convolution seen in keras\n",

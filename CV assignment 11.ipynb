    "2.Ans-Non Maximum Suppression is a computer vision method that selects a single entity out of many overlapping entities (for example bounding boxes in object detection). The criteria is usually discarding entities that are below a given probability bound\n",

    "A PR curve is simply a graph with Precision values on the y-axis and Recall values on the x-axis. In other words, the PR curve contains TP/(TP+FN) on the y-axis and TP/(TP+FP) on the x-axis. It is important to note that Precisi\n",

    "7.Ans-What is Selective Search? Selective Search is a region proposal algorithm used in object detection. It is designed to be fast with a very high recall. It is based on computing hierarchical grouping of similar regions based on color, texture, size and shape compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Ans--Faster R-CNN is a single-stage model that is trained end-to-end. It uses a novel region proposal network (RPN) for generating region proposals, which save time compared to traditional algorithms like Selective Search. It uses the ROI Pooling layer to extract a fixed-length feature vector from each region proposal.\n",

    "1.ans-To sum-up: 'trainable parameters' are those which value is modified according to their gradient (the derivative of the error/loss/cost relative to the parameter), whereas 'non-trainable parameters' are those which value is not optimized according to their gradient\n",

    "2.Ans-We can apply a Dropout layer to the input vector, in which case it nullifies some of its features; but we can also apply it to a hidden layer, in which case it nullifies some hidden neurons. Dropout layers are important in training CNNs because they prevent overfitting on the training data.\n",

    "3.Ans--The number of hidden neurons should be between the size of the input layer and the size of the output layer. The number of hidden neurons should be 2/3 the size of the input layer, plus the size of the output layer. The number of hidden neurons should be less than twice the size of the input layer.\n",

    "5.Ans--A traditional default value for the learning rate is 0.1 or 0.01, and this may represent a good starting point on your problem\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Ans--An Activation Function decides whether a neuron should be activated or not. This means that it will decide whether the neuron's input to the network is important or not in the process of prediction using simpler mathematical operations\n",

    "7.Ans-Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database. This includes creating tables and establishing relationships between those tables according to rules designed both to protect the data and to make the database more flexible by eliminating redundancy and inconsistent dependency.\n",

    "\n",
    "8.Ans--Image augmentation is a technique of altering the existing data to create some more data for the model training process. In other words, it is the process of artificially expanding the available dataset for training a deep learning model.\n",

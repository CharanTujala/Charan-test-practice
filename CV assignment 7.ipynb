    "1.ans-Covariate shift occurs when the distribution of variables in the training data is different to real-world or testing data. This means that the model may make the wrong predictions once it is deployed, and its accuracy will be significantly lower\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Ans--Batch-Normalization (BN) is an algorithmic method which makes the training of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) faster and more stable. It consists of normalizing activation vectors from hidden layers using the first and the second statistical moments (mean and variance) of the current batch\n",

    "3.Ans--Using our own terms and diagrams, explain LENET ARCHITECTURE.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Ans--The Alexnet has eight layers with learnable parameters. The model consists of five layers with a combination of max pooling followed by 3 fully connected layers and they use Relu activation in each of these layers except the output layer\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Ans--When there are more layers in the network, the value of the product of derivative decreases until at some point the partial derivative of the loss function approaches a value close to zero, and the partial derivative vanishes. We call this the vanishing gradient problem\n",

    "6.Ans--In biological brain functionality, there is a concept called lateral inhibition. This refers to the capacity of one stimulated neuron to bring its neighbors under control. The main agenda for us is to have a local peak value for finding the maximum value in the neighborhood.\n",

    "9.Ans-VGG is an innovative object-recognition model that supports up to 19 layers. Built as a deep CNN, VGG also outperforms baselines on many tasks and datasets outside of ImageNet. VGG is now still one of the most used image-recognition architectures\n",

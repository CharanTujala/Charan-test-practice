    "1.Ans--summation, in physiology, the additive effect of several electrical impulses on a neuromuscular junction, the junction between a nerve cell and a muscle cell. Individually the stimuli cannot evoke a response, but collectively they can generate a response\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Ans-A step function is a function like that used by the original Perceptron. The output is a certain value, A1, if the input sum is above a certain threshold and A0 if the input sum is below a certain threshold. The values used by the Perceptron were A1 = 1 and A0 = 0\n",

    "3.Ans-The McCulloch-Pitts model was an extremely simple artificial neuron. The inputs could be either a zero or a one. And the output was a zero or a one. And each input could be either excitatory or inhibitory\n",

    "4.Ans--MADALINE (Many ADALINE) is a three-layer (input, hidden, output), fully connected, feed-forward artificial neural network architecture for classification that uses ADALINE units in its hidden and output layers, i.e. its activation function is the sign function. The three-layer network uses memistors.\n",

    "7.Ans-The XOr problem is that we need to build a Neural Network (a perceptron in our case) to produce the truth table related to the XOr logical operator. This is a binary classification problem. Hence, supervised learning is a better way to solve it. In this case, we will be using perceptrons.\n",

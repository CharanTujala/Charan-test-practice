    "1.Ans--What happens when you increase or decrease the optimizer learning rate\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Ans--Because each hidden neuron added will increase the number of weights, thus it is recommended to use the least number of hidden neurons that accomplish the task. Using more hidden neurons than required will add more complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Ans--Finding: large batch size means the model makes very large gradient updates and very small gradient updates. The size of the update depends heavily on which particular samples are drawn from the dataset. On the other hand using small batch size means the model makes updates that are all about the same size.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4.Ans--Regularization comes into play and shrinks the learned estimates towards zero. In other words, it tunes the loss function by adding a penalty term, that prevents excessive fluctuation of the coefficients. Thereby, reducing the chances of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Ans--The terms cost function & loss function are analogous. Loss function: Used when we refer to the error for a single training example. Cost function: Used to refer to an average of the loss functions over an entire training dataset.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "6.Ans-Underfitting is a scenario in data science where a data model is unable to capture the relationship between the input and output variables accurately, generating a high error rate on both the training set and unseen data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Ans--Dropout regularization is a technique to prevent neural networks from overfitting. Dropout works by randomly disabling neurons and their corresponding connections. This prevents the network from relying too much on single neurons and forces all neurons to learn to generalize better."

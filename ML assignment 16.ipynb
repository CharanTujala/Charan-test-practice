    "1.Ans--Independent Variables\n",
    "If x and y are two variables in an algebraic equation and every value of x is linked with any other value of y, then 'y' value is said to be a function of x value known as an independent variable, and 'y' value is known as a dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Ans--We could use the equation to predict weight if we knew an individual's height. In this example, if an individual was 70 inches tall, we would predict his weight to be: Weight = 80 + 2 x (70) = 220 lbs. In this simple linear regression, we are examining the impact of one independent variable on the outcome.\n",

    "3.Ans--A linear regression line has an equation of the form Y = a + bX, where X is the explanatory variable and Y is the dependent variable. The slope of the line is b, and a is the intercept (the value of y when x = 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Ans--In summary, if the slope is positive, y increases as x increases, and the function runs \"uphill\" (going left to right). If the slope is negative, y decreases as x increases and the function runs downhill. If the slope is zero, y does not change, thus is constant—a horizontal line.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Ans--If the slope is negative, y decreases as x increases and the function runs downhill. If the slope is zero, y does not change, thus is constant—a horizontal line. Vertical lines are problematic in that there is no change in x.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Ans--Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. Multiple regression is an extension of linear (OLS) regression that uses just one explanatory variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10.Ans--Ridge regression is a model tuning method that is used to analyse any data that suffers from multicollinearity. This method performs L2 regularization. When the issue of multicollinearity occurs, least-squares are unbiased, and variances are large, this results in predicted values being far away from the actual values.\n",

    "1.Ans--Supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled data. Unsupervised learning algorithms are trained using unlabeled data. Supervised learning model takes direct feedback to check if it is predicting correct output or not. Unsupervised learning model does not take any feedback.\n",

    "2.Ans--Some of the common applications where unsupervised learning is used are:\n",

    "3.Ans--What are the three main types of clustering methods? Briefly describe the characteristics of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Ans--K-means allocates every data point in the dataset to the nearest centroid (minimizing Euclidean distances between them), meaning that a data point is considered to be in a particular cluster if it is closer to that cluster's centroid than any other centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Ans--K-means attempts to minimize the total squared error, while k-medoids minimizes the sum of dissimilarities between points labeled to be in a cluster and a point designated as the center of that cluster. In contrast to the k -means algorithm, k -medoids chooses datapoints as centers ( medoids or exemplars).\n",

    "6.Ans--A dendrogram is a diagram that shows the attribute distances between each pair of sequentially merged classes. To avoid crossing lines, the diagram is graphically arranged so that members of each pair of classes to be merged are neighbors in the diagram. The Dendrogram tool uses a hierarchical clustering algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Ans--SSE is defined as the sum of the squared distance between centroid and each member of the cluster. Then plot a K against SSE graph. We will observe that as K increases SSE decreases as disortation will be small. So the idea of this algorithm is to choose the value of K at which the graph decrease abruptly.\n",

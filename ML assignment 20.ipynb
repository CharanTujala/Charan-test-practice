    "1.Ans--SVM or Support Vector Machine is a linear model for classification and regression problems. It can solve linear and non-linear problems and work well for many practical problems. The idea of SVM is simple: The algorithm creates a line or a hyperplane which separates the data into classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Ans--Support vectors are data points that are closer to the hyperplane and influence the position and orientation of the hyperplane. Using these support vectors, we maximize the margin of the classifier. Deleting the support vectors will change the position of the hyperplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Ans-Because Support Vector Machine (SVM) optimization occurs by minimizing the decision vector w, the optimal hyperplane is influenced by the scale of the input features and it's therefore recommended that data be standardized (mean 0, var 1) prior to SVM model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Ans--When an SVM classifier classifies a case, can it output a confidence score? What about a\n",

    "\n",
    "5.Ans--So if there are millions of instances, you should definitely use the primal form, because the dual form will be much too slow. Say you trained an SVM classifier with an RBF kernel.\n",

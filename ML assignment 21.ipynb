    "1.Ans--What is the approximate depth of a Decision Tree trained (without restrictions) on a training set with 1 million instances? (106) â‰ˆ 20 (actually a bit more since the tree will generally not be perfectly well balanced).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Ans--A node's Gini impurity is generally lower than its parent's. This is ensured by the CART training algorithm's cost function, which splits each node in a way that minimizes the weighted sum of its children's Gini impurities\n",

    "3.Ans--Explain if its a good idea to reduce max depth if a Decision Tree is overfitting the training set\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Ans--If a Decision Tree is underfitting the training set, is it a good idea to try scaling the input features? Decision Trees don't care whether or not the training data is scaled or centered; scaling the input features will just be a waste of time.\n",

    "6.Ans--If your training set contains 100,000 instances, will setting presort=True speed up training? Presorting the training set speeds up training only if the dataset is smaller than a few thousand instances. If it contains 100,000 instances, setting presort=True will considerably slow down training.\n",

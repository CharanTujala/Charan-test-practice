    "1.Ans--Data preprocessing is a process of preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a machine learning model. It is the first and crucial step while creating a machine learning model. When creating a machine learning project, it is not always a case that we come across the clean and formatted data.\n",

    "2.Ans-Quantitative data is numbers-based, countable, or measurable. Qualitative data is interpretation-based, descriptive, and relating to language. Quantitative data tells us how many, how much, or how often in calculations. Qualitative data can help us to understand why, how, or what happened behind certain behaviors.\n",

If the missing value is of type Missing At Random (MAR) or Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) then it can be deleted. The disadvantage of this method is one might end up deleting some useful data from the dataset.\n",

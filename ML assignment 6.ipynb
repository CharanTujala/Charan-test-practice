    "1.Ans--Training a model simply means learning (determining) good values for all the weights and the bias from labeled examples. In supervised learning, a machine learning algorithm builds a model by examining many examples and attempting to find a model that minimizes loss; this process is called empirical risk minimization\n",

    "\n",
    "2.Ans--The No Free Lunch Theorem is often thrown around in the field of optimization and machine learning, often with little understanding of what it means or implies. The theorem states that all optimization algorithms perform equally well when their performance is averaged across all possible problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Ans--In k-fold cross-validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal sized subsamples. Of the k subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining k âˆ’ 1 subsamples are used as training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Ans-The bootstrap method is a resampling technique used to estimate statistics on a population by sampling a dataset with replacement. It can be used to estimate summary statistics such as the mean or standard deviation.\n",

    "how to measure the Kappa value of a classification model using a sample collection of results.\n",

    "6.Ans--Ensemble methods is a machine learning technique that combines several base models in order to produce one optimal predictive model . To better understand this definition lets take a step back into ultimate goal of machine learning and model building\n",

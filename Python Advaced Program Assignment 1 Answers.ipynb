    "1.Ans--In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Ans--The whole point of a namespace tool like the class statement is to support name inheritance. In Python, inheritance happens when an object is qualified, and involves searching an attribute definition tree (one or more namespaces). Every time you use an expression of the form object\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Ans--instance object inherits the attributes of the class object from which it was created. class object is like a blueprint for intance object but instance object is a concrete item in out code. instance objects are new namespaces, thay start out empty but inherit object attributes that live in class object.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Ans--The class from which a class inherits is called the parent or superclass. A class which inherits from a superclass is called a subclass, also called heir class or child class. Superclasses are sometimes called ancestors as well\n",

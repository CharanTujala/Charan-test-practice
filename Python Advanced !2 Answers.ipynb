    "Strings are Arrays\n",
    "Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters. However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string\n",

    "2.Ans--The logical operators and, or and not are also referred to as boolean operators. While and as well as or operator needs two operands, which may evaluate to true or false, not operator needs one operand evaluating to true or false. Boolean and operator returns true if both operands return true\n",

    "3.Ans--“Indexing” means referring to an element of an iterable by its position within the iterable. “Slicing” means getting a subset of elements from an iterable based on their indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Ans--String indexing in Python is zero-based i.e., first character in the string has index value “0” and the next character in the string has value “1” and so on. There are two types of sting indexing: positive string indexing and negative string indexing.\n",

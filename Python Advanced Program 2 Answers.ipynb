    "1.Ans---So a module in python is simply a way to organize the code, and it contains either python classes or just functions. If you need those classes or functions in your project, you just import them. For instance, the math module in python contains just a bunch of functions, and you just call those needed \n",

    "2-Ans--To create instances of a class, you call the class using class name and pass in whatever arguments its __init__ method accepts\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Ans--Class attributes belong to the class itself they will be shared by all the instances. Such attributes are defined in the class body parts usually at the top, for legibility. Unlike class attributes, instance attributes are not shared by objects\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Ans--An instance attribute is a Python variable belonging to one, and only one, object. This variable is only accessible in the scope of this object and it is defined inside the constructor function, __init__(self,..) of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Ans--elf represents the instance of the class. By using the “self” we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments. The reason you need to use self. is because Python does not use the @ syntax to refer to instance attributes\n",

    "1.ANS-When a class is derived from more than one base class it is called multiple Inheritance. The derived class inherits all the features of the base case. Syntax: Class Base1: Body of the class Class Base2: Body of the class Class Derived(Base1, Base2): Body of the class\n",
    " 2. ANS-What is Delegation? According to Wikipedia, “the delegation pattern is an object-oriented design pattern that allows object composition to achieve the same code reuse as inheritance.” If you read that sentence four or five times you might get it but let me try to make it simpler \n",

    "3.ans-Composition is a concept that models a has a relationship. It enables creating complex types by combining objects of other types. This means that a class Composite can contain an object of another class Component . This relationship means that a Composite has a Component \n",

    "4.Ans-This is sometimes misleadingly called private attributes really, it's just a way to localize a name to the class that created it, and does not prevent access by code outside the class. That is, this feature is mostly intended to avoid namespace collisions in instances, not to restrict access to names in general."
